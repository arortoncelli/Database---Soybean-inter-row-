Database - Soybean inter-row 
This database presents a set of row and inter-row images of soybean plantations collected by a camera attached to a weeder. The photos were labeled using the VGG Image Annotator (https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/).

Three sets of images are available:
Training images are inside the folder train.
Validation images are inside the folder val.
Evaluation images are inside the evaluation folder.
